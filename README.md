Learning Software engineering essentials. 
I can recommend the following courses at edx.org:
> https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:TUMx+EASEx+2T2017/course/
> https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UBCx+SoftConst1x+3T2017/course/
> https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS101x+1T2017/course/

Mostly essentials, but it's worthy it. If you have any questions or ideas, do not hesitate and share them!

Best regards,

Filip
